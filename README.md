# Meliora

A mobile workout app built with VueJS, VuexORM and Quasar. The app loosely follows the 5x5 workout program found [here](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) but allows for more user customizations.

Right now the App is in on going development with an expected beta release on Android in the near future.
